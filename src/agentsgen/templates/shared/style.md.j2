### Style & conventions ({{ stack }})

#### 1) Follow the repo
- Match existing naming, structure, and patterns.
- Don’t introduce new abstractions unless they reduce complexity.

#### 2) Readability wins
- Prefer clear code over clever code.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose.
- Choose explicit names over short names.

#### 3) Errors & edge cases
- Validate inputs at boundaries.
- Fail loudly for programmer errors, gracefully for user errors.
- Add helpful error messages (actionable, not vague).

#### 4) Logging (if applicable)
- Log meaningful events, not noise.
- Never log secrets or personal data.

#### 5) Types / docs (if applicable)
- Add type hints where it improves clarity.
- Add docstrings for public functions and tricky logic.
- Write comments only when the “why” is non-obvious.

#### 6) Dependencies
- Prefer standard library / existing deps.
- Avoid adding heavy dependencies for small tasks.
